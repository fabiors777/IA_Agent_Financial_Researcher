# 💹 Financial Analysis Multi-Agent System

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **AI-driven multi-agent system** designed to perform comprehensive financial market analysis.  
Using the **Agno Framework** integrated with **OpenAI’s GPT models**, the system simulates a collaborative environment where multiple intelligent agents interact to research, analyze, and produce a cohesive financial report.

## 🧠 Concept and Purpose

The main goal of this system is to **replicate a real-world financial analysis workflow** through artificial intelligence.  
Each agent in the team specializes in a specific task, and together they collaborate to generate detailed, data-driven insights.

The project aims to:
- Automate complex research and analytical processes in finance.  
- Enable intelligent collaboration between specialized AI agents.  
- Deliver structured, transparent, and explainable market reports.  
- Provide a foundation for scalable financial intelligence applications.

## 👥 Team of Agents

### **1. Financial Researcher**
Responsible for collecting and synthesizing up-to-date information from reliable financial and economic sources.  
This agent gathers:
- Market news and press releases  
- Economic indicators and trends  
- Sector data and company-specific information  

It ensures that all research is timely, factual, and clearly referenced.

---

### **2. Financial Analyst**
Focuses on interpreting the data collected by the Researcher and transforming it into professional-level insights.  
The analyst performs:
- Fundamental analysis (valuation metrics, profitability, leverage)  
- Market sentiment evaluation and analyst recommendations  
- Risk and opportunity assessment within the sector context  

The output is a clear, well-structured analytical narrative designed for decision support.

### **3. Financial Team (Coordinator)**
Acts as the **project manager** of the agents’ collaboration.  
It coordinates the workflow, ensures alignment between research and analysis, validates findings, and compiles the final report.  
The coordinator also determines when consensus has been reached and concludes the session.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User Input** – The user provides a financial topic or a company ticker (e.g., *BBAS3.SA – Banco do Brasil*).  
2. **Research Phase** – The Researcher agent searches for current data, news, and indicators.  
3. **Analysis Phase** – The Analyst interprets those findings, applies financial reasoning, and produces key insights.  
4. **Coordination Phase** – The Team Lead merges both perspectives and finalizes a unified financial report.  
5. **Output** – The system delivers a structured Markdown-formatted report including an executive summary, metrics, trends, and risks.

## 📊 Expected Results

The final reports generated by the multi-agent system include:
- **Executive Summary** of the stock or company  
- **Key Financial Indicators** with contextual comparison  
- **Recent Market News** and their potential impacts  
- **Sector Trends and Competitive Positioning**  
- **Risks, Limitations, and Forecast Scenarios**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an intelligent, modular, and reusable framework for financial AI agents  
- Demonstrate how collaborative reasoning improves analytical quality  
- Integrate multiple data sources (search tools, finance APIs, reasoning modules)  
- Support transparent, auditable, and data-driven decision making
